	<h2>Governance</h2>
		<p>
			ResearchOps needs to provide researchers with an informed framework
			for conducting research that is safe, legal and ethical.
		</p>
		<p>
			Governance of Research is something that continues long after the
			research is done. Governance can include governance of ethics across
			an organisation, maintaining and developing appropriate consent
			forms, including records management of completed consent forms. It
			is undertaking risk assessments either with or for researchers. It
			is ensuring safe working environments for researchers. It is
			information security. ResearchOps includes managing privacy and
			Non-Disclosure Agreements.

<section id="tools">
	<h2>Tools</h2>
	<p>
		Selecting the right research tool is hard. And not all teams can use the same tools. ResearchOps including helping researchers find the right tools, at the right time, for the right need. That includes managing access and use of tools, including managing licenses, training, on-boarding, and permissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our <a href="toolbox.researchops.community">2022 ReOps Tools Census</a>, we’ve crowdsourced information from ResearchOps practitioners from around the world to provide insight into what other ResearchOps teams are using in their daily work. This project continues to iterate and expand in order to better serve the community’s needs.

<section id="knowledge-management">
	<h2>Knowledge management</h2>
	<p>
		Knowledge management is a hot topic in ResearchOps. Knowledge management
		is heavily intertwined with research governance and the socialisation of
		research. There are many, many platforms available for researchers to
		gather, store, synthesise and reuse their research. There are a growing
		number of platforms for socialising research, and a few that mix between
		the two.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowledge management includes taxonomies, structured vocabularies,
		librarianship. It includes a strategy and a solution for surfacing and
		delivering insights and findings to research consumers. A good research
		repository, corpus or library includes one or more librarians to
		undertake data gardening and develop a research narrative across the
		organisation and across research. View the 
		<a

			>list of existing
		platforms for gathering, storing, analysing, synthesising and sharing
		research</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The community is developing relevant content from the Research
		Repositories Project about knowledge management. The first of these is
		an Alpha version of a
		<a href="https://kumu.io/TeamReOps/researchops-taxonomy"
			>taxonomy for user research</a
		>.
		We need your help to iterate this and get it to the
		next phase!

<section id="capability-and-opportunity">
	<h2>Capability &amp; opportunity</h2>
	<p>
		ResearchOps people have a role in developing researchers. Ops people are
		uniquely positioned to understand the breadth of research across an
		organisation and can therefore serve as a centralising function for
		capability development. This can include housing Centres of Excellence,
		co-designing training and career frameworks and working with research
		leaders to manage career development.

<section id="guides-and-templates">
	<h2>Guides and templates</h2>
	<p>
		In the #WhatIsResearchOps workshops, the most commonly noted aspect of
		operations was that ResearchOps includes guides for things like
		recruitment, ethics, etc. Lots of people wanted ReOps people to help
		them understand if their methods and methodologies met the right
		standard, both inside their own organisations and internationally.
		ResearchOps includes templates for research briefings, for research
		artefacts. Each of these guides needs a platform or database and someone
		to maintain them.

<section id="event-management">
	<h2>Event management</h2>
	<p>
		ResearchOps includes managing the logistics, tools and resources for
		off-site events, onsite events, team meetings, sharebacks, retros and
		arranging for speakers to attend events where the socialisation of
		research is involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		ResearchOps is as much about people and forging relationships and
		connections as it is about efficiency, support, and data.

<section id="recruitment">
	<h2>Recruitment</h2>
	<p>
		Recruitment is one of the most challenging aspects of conducting
		research. Good Ops management of recruitment includes the tools,
		databases and schedules but also the small things that make a
		difference- managing effective incentives, saying thank you. Maintaining
		relationships with external recruiters or with a customer panel,
		ensuring the participants meet the needs of the research. That means
		having an in-depth understanding of research and the goals of the
		research.

<section id="asset-management">
	<h2>Asset management</h2>
	<p>
		Asset management is about where you store raw or processed data, whether
		A/V or other forms of documentation. It&rsquo;s not about making the
		data useful, just findable and secured. It is heavily tied in with data
		security. It is also about managing audio recorders and video equipment.

<section id="research-spaces">
	<h2>Research spaces</h2>
	<p>
		Researchers do research in all kinds of places. Out in the field, in
		labs, in offices, in workshops. Researchers need space to move and talk.
		They need tools to collaborate online and offline. They need walls and
		tables, pens and yes, sticky notes.
	</p>
	<a href="#tableOfContents">Back to Top</a>
</section>

<section id="budget-management">
	<h2>Budget management</h2>
	<p>
		All those tools and spaces and things come at a cost. ResearchOps is
		about tracking operational spend and helping researchers go through
		budgetary processes and submissions. Strategic Operations involves
		working with research leadership to ensure there is sufficient budget in
		place to purchase or design and develop tools ahead of researcher need.
		There is an Ops function in tracking the impact of all of that
		socialisation of the research.

<section id="socialising-communicating-evangelizing">
	<h2>Socialising, communicating and evangelising about research</h2>
	<p>
		Researchers spend a lot of their time socialising their research and
		evangelising about the need for research. ResearchOps has a role to play
		in assisting with, or doing this socialisation work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where a mature knowledge structure exists, there also exists the
		capacity to socialise that research on behalf of researchers, taking on
		the complex governance of extending access to research to the right
		people within the boundaries of existing rules regarding ethics and
		consent.
